# hmpps-open-layers-map-webcomponent-poc-ui
A native Web Component for rendering OpenLayers maps

### 🌐 Browser Support

Native Web Components are supported in:

- ✅ **Chrome** 54+
- ✅ **Firefox** 63+
- ✅ **Safari** 10.1+
- ✅ **Edge** 79+ (Chromium-based)
- ❌ **Internet Explorer 11** - _not supported without polyfills (not recommended)_

### 🔄 Fallback Strategy

This component targets **modern browsers only** (Chrome 54+, Firefox 63+, Safari 10.1+, Edge 79+).

- ❌ **IE11 is not supported** due to lack of native Web Component APIs.
- Do **not recommend using polyfills** for IE11, as performance and reliability are poor.
- If legacy support is critical, consider using a separate Nunjucks-based implementation.
